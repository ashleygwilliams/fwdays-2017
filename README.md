Every day, there are approximately 2,500,000 npm install events.

Each one of those events installs around 50 packages.

npm, combined with the power and ease of Node.js's module loading system,
has heralded a new age of modular architecture. This talk will walk
through some of the fascinating data that npm has been able to collect
recently about the node community. We'll make some specific observations
about the current node community's behavior inside npm's ecosystem,
pointing out critical moments in Node.js's and npm's geneaology. We'll
conclude by drawing several interesting implications for the future of
node and "the modular way".
